# A+ test course

This is an A+ course that can be used for **manual testing of A+ features**.
This course showcases many A+ features including less common edge cases
so that they all could be conveniently tested manually.
This is mostly intended for **A+ platform developers**
when they are developing the A+ frontend or microservices.

**A+ course developers** should study the [A+ manual](https://github.com/apluslms/aplus-manual).
It contains more useful example exercises and explains more about how to develop A+ courses.

## Git branches

* `master`: monolingual RST course (course content defined in one language, English)
* `multilang`: multilingual RST course (course content defined in two languages, Finnish and English)
* `indexyaml`: course with no RST content with a manually written index.yaml configuration file

## Modules

* `links1` and `links2`: hyperlinks between content chapters, to external sites and to downloadable files

**More modules for different kinds of A+ features shall be added here!**

**Ideas**:

* exercises of all view types available in the MOOC-Grader
* questionnaires (try out all settings, partial points in checkboxes, random questions etc.)
* all directives in a-plus-rst-tools
* Radar settings in exercises
* MOOC-Jutut feedback questionnaire
* Rubyric exercise
* Acos exercises
* JSAV exercises
