    This is a sample of presenting learning material in <code>HTML</code> format.
    The material can employ any of the web features, such as
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>images,</li>
    <li>videos,</li>
    <li>and JavaScript programs.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p>
      A+ should be able to fix links into other A+ chapters and static files in the course git repository,
      but there have been some bugs in the past.
    </p>

    <p>Absolute links always work.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Furthermore, interactive exercises may be embedded inside the material.
    Here is the arithmetic questionnaire sample but this time embedded
    in to the chapter.
  </p>
  <div data-aplus-exercise="yes" data-aplus-quiz></div>
  <p>
    We hope that looking at the configuration files, resources, and programs
    inside this learning material repository helps to get started
    with creating material of your own!
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us know how it goes.
